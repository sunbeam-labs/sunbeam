Sunbeam is a pipeline written in [snakemake](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io) that simplifies and automates many of the steps in metagenomic sequencing analysis. It can be installed through PyPi (pip), Bioconda (conda), DockerHub (docker), or GitHub (git). Sunbeam was designed to be modular and extensible, allowing anyone to build off the core functionality. To read more, check out [our paper in Microbiome](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-019-0658-x).

Sunbeam currently automates the following tasks:

* Quality control, including adapter trimming, host read removal, and quality filtering;
* Taxonomic assignment of reads to databases using [Kraken](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken) ([sbx_kraken](https://github.com/sunbeam-labs/sbx_kraken));
* Assembly of reads into contigs using [Megahit](https://github.com/voutcn/megahit) ([sbx_assembly](https://github.com/sunbeam-labs/sbx_assembly));
* Contig annotation using BLAST[n/p/x] and Diamond ([sbx_assembly](https://github.com/sunbeam-labs/sbx_assembly));
* Mapping to reference genomes ([sbx_mapping](https://github.com/sunbeam-labs/sbx_mapping))
* ORF prediction using [Prodigal](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal) ([sbx_assembly](https://github.com/sunbeam-labs/sbx_assembly)).
