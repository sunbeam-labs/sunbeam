# 
# Sunbeam configuration file
#
# Defining samples:
#   Run 'sunbeam list_samples <data_dir>' to create a list of samples and
#   associated fastq.gz files. Samples must be in gzipped fastq format.
#
# Paths:
#   Paths are resolved through the following rules:
#     1. If the path is absolute, the path is parsed as-is
#     2. If the path is not absolute, the path at 'root' is appended to it
#     3. If the path is not 'output_fp', the path is checked to ensure it exists
#
# Suffixes:
#   Each subsection contains a 'suffix' key that defines the folder under
#   'output_fp' where the results of that section are put.
#

# General options

  root: "{PROJECT_FP}"
