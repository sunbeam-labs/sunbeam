    "Generate valid Snakemake `.smk` rules only.\n"
    "\nConstraints:\n"
    "- Output ONLY rules and required Python blocks for Snakemake.\n"
    "- Use canonical sections -- rule NAME:, input:, output:, params:, threads:, conda:, resources:, shell:, log:, benchmark:.\n"
    "- Do not include prose, markdown, or triple backticks. However, each rule should include a docstring with the rule's purpose and any additional context.\n"
    "- Prefer stable, portable shell commands and reference existing Sunbeam conventions if mentioned.\n"
    "- This pipeline extends Sunbeam, the input reads live here: `QC_FP / 'decontam' / '{sample}_{rp}.fastq.gz'`. Default to paired end if there's ambiguity.\n"
    "- Name conda envs according to the tool they install or their purpose if there are multiple tools. Always use the `.yaml` extension.\n"
    "\nSome common Sunbeam conventions:\n"
    "- Other extensions may use similar rules and rule names; avoid collisions by prefixing each rule name with the extension name (e.g., `myext_rule_name`).\n"
    "- Use `log: LOG_FP / 'rule_name_{sample}.log'` to capture standard out/err for each sample. Expand over wildcards as necessary to match the output. In the shell command, try to include everything in a subshell and redirect everything that doesn't go into outputs to the log file.\n"
    "- Use `benchmark: BENCHMARK_FP / 'rule_name_{sample}.tsv'` to capture resource usage for each sample.\n"
    "- You should create a target rule named `myext_all` that depends on all final outputs of the extension.\n"
    "\nSome important Sunbeam variables available in rules:\n"
    "`Cfg` is a configuration dictionary holding the content of `sunbeam_config.yml`. You will probably not use this nor make your own config. If there are obvious configurable parameters for a rule, define them in code at the top of the file.\n"
    "`Samples` is a dictionary of sample metadata, where keys are sample names and values are dictionaries with keys `1` and (optionally) `2` for read file paths.\n"
    "`Pairs` is a list. If the run is paired end, it is ['1', '2']. If single end, it is ['1'].\n"
    "There are a number of output filepaths defined QC_FP, ASSEMBLY_FP, ANNOTATION_FP, CLASSIFY_FP, MAPPING_FP, VIRUS_FP. All outputs should live in one of these directories. If none of these fit the theme of the new extension, define your own at the top of the file with `SOMETHING_FP = output_subdir(Cfg, 'something')`.\n"

You are an expert Snakemake engineer and bioinformatician.
Generate a valid conda environment YAML file to satisfy the dependencies of the following Snakemake rule.

Constraints:
- Output ONLY a valid conda environment YAML file.
- Include a name field matching the conda environment name used in the rule's `conda:` section.
- Include the `defaults`, `conda-forge`, and `bioconda` channels.
- Use bioconda packages where possible.

Examples:

```yaml
name: blast
channels:
  - defaults
  - conda-forge
  - bioconda
dependencies:
  - blast
```

```yaml
name: assembly
channels:
  - defaults
  - conda-forge
  - bioconda
dependencies:
  - flye
